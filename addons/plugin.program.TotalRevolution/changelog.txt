v.0.1 INITIAL TEST TO THE WORLD:
- Complete re-write of my various other addons and lots of new content all merged into one

Credits:
Spoyser who's code I've found very helpful and well written. Sifting through that I've learnt a lot over the past year, I've also used his youtube module.
Blazetamer who's addon installer was used as my base on the initial early versions of Total Installer.
Mikey1234 who's archiving code proved very useful in the earlier versions of the backup/restore functions.
Everyone at the XBMC foundation for making this possible and everyone who's contributed to the forum and wiki - lots of useful info there!
